# AC Simulator

A tiny 2D OpenGL demo of an AC remote and unit.

- Toggle the lamp to power the AC on or off.
- Adjust the desired temperature with the arrow panel or keyboard keys.
- Vent animates; status icon reflects temps; water fills over time and Space drains it.
- Cursor is always a built-in procedural design.

Build & Run: Open ac-simulator.sln in Visual Studio (x64), build, and run. The window resizes and centers the scene automatically.
